# 2048 Game in C++ - Using Conditions and For Loops

![image](https://github.com/Erkesto/2048-game/assets/62474995/f588d4bf-dfb7-42a0-a66f-960581148f16)

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic 2048 game in C++, developed from scratch using only conditions and for loops. The game is played in the terminal/console, providing a basic yet entertaining experience.

## Features

- Command-line-based gameplay.
- Basic graphics using ASCII characters.
- Implemented using only conditions and for loops.
- C++ standard libraries used: `<iostream>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<stdlib.h>`.

## How to Play

1. Compile the game using a C++ compiler. For example, you can use G++:

   ```sh
   g++ main.cpp -o 2048_game 
2. Run as compiled executable:

 ```sh
   2048_game.exe
 ```
3. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to shift the tiles in the desired direction.
4. Tiles with the same value will merge when they collide.
5. The goal is to reach the 2048 tile.
